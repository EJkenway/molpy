# Welcome to molpy

`molpy` aims to provide a unified and coherent representation of molecular systems, encompassing particles, topological information, force field parameters, simulation cell definitions, and related components. The framework is designed to facilitate systematic modeling, analysis, and interoperability across molecular simulation workflows.

As a core component of the `MolCrafts` project, `molpy` provides the foundational data structures and abstractions upon which higher-level functionalities are built. Performance-critical and well-validated modules are progressively reimplemented in C++ to ensure high efficiency and cross-platform compatibility. Designed with extensibility in mind, MolPy allows researchers to customize and extend its functionality to accommodate diverse modeling requirements.

## Installation

Use `pip` to install `molpy`:

```bash
pip install molpy
```

## Getting Started

`molpy` manual is organized into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the library. The following sections will guide you through the key features and functionalities of `molpy`:

- [Getting Started](https://molpy.molcrafts.org/getting-started/): An introduction to the core data structures and functionalities of `molpy`.
