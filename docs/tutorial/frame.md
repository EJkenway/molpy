# Frame

The core of molpy is `Frame` object. It contains all the information of a molecular system. It is the data structure that molpy uses to store and manipulate molecular data. 

Here are two types of `Frame`. The first one is called `DynamicFrame`, which is flexible to add or delete atoms and bonds. The second one is called `StaticFrame`, which is immutable. It is used to store the initial state of a molecular system.
