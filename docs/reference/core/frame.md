# Frame

The `Frame` is a static data structure designed for aligning and handling data efficiently, particularly suited for numerical calculations with NumPy, as well as for reading and writing data, without altering the underlying topology. It serves as a standardized format for integration with other components and calculators.

In contrast, the `Struct` is a dynamic data structure optimized for editing molecular structures.

The `Frame` is built upon a pandas DataFrame, functioning as a multi-key directory. All operations are executed using pandas, one of the most widely-used libraries in modern Python programming. Leveraging pandas, additional convenient methods tailored to chemical applications have been incorporated.
